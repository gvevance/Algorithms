'''
Bubble sort is not a something we would normally do intuitively. Start from arr[0] to the right. When the cursor 
is at i, compare A[i] and A[i+1] and swap them if needed. At the end of the kth iteration, the largest k elements 
will all be in their right positions and we do not need to compare with them. Worst case - (n)(n-1)/2 compare + 
swaps. So O(n^2).
